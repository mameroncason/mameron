I'm fotunate to have been the first employee at Remodel Health, a health benefits startup in Indianapolis. I've served in various roles, but currently lead our product and technology efforts.

I'm married to Laura and dad to Pumba & Jetta, our goldendoodles. We reside in Indy's best historic community, Irvington. We've visited 18 of 60 National Parks. I enjoy seeing home projects come to life and coach elementary girls basketball.
